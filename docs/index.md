Cloud service providers like AWS offer valuable tools for collection and management of data, like message queues and data storage, but often setup and use of these services is specific to the cloud provider. At balena our mission is to reduce friction for our fleet owners. So we provide a *cloud block* container, whose aim is to provide a simple, consistent interface to these services, configured by environment variables. Initially we support only the cloud provider's message queue service.
